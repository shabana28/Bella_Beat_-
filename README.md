# Project_01_-
Revitalize Bella Beat's marketing with insightful analysis for heightened brand impact and sustained growth.


#BUSINESS TASK
   This analysis's primary aim is to systematically examine the utilization of smart devices, discern potential insights and trends and formulate high-level recommendations for enhancing Bellabeat's  marketing strategy.

#Description of Data source
    The dataset provided by Kaggle's data analyst Mobius investigates the daily habits of smart device users through 30 Fitbit trackers offering minute-level data on physical activity and sleep.

#Cleaning and transforming data
     *Checking data for errors
     *Checking for missing values
     *Checking for data integrity(DISTINCT values)
     *Data Transformation-> By changing the time format from minutes to hours in the sleep_day table and daily activity table

 #Data analysis
      *Short view of data summary
      
#Results driven through analysis of data
       *We notice that the average users of Bellabeat smart devices are active people with an average of approximately 4 hours a day, with an average of approximately 8000 steps per day, according to our data.
       *According to the daily sleep data, we can also notice that the average people who use Bellabeat smart devices have a healthy lifestyle with an average of 7 hours of daily sleeping, according to the data tracked with those devices.

#VISUALISATION
       #Correlation matrix_fig_01
       *The correlation visual indicates a positive correlation between total steps and calories burned, and obviously with total distance.

      #Relation between daily steps and calories burned_fig_02
        *indicates a positive correlation between the total daily steps taken and the total calories Fitbit users burn. This correlation suggests that there is a direct relationship between the number of steps taken and the amount of calories burned, where an increase in steps taken is proportional to an increase in calories burned.

#Correlation between sleep time and sedentary time 
         The correlation between sleep time and sedentary time is negative. This indicates a negative correlation between inactive time and sleep time. This suggests that less active users tend to sleep less than 6 hours or, in some cases, more than 10 hours; however, active people tend to have a healthier sleep quality of 7 to 8 hours a day. This explains that activity directly correlates with sleep quality and a healthy lifestyle in general.


#CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO BUSINESS
        *It is clear that inactive people have a negative lifestyle; the opposite applies. During the analysis, the following findings were confirmed:

Our data demonstrates that everyday long-distance walking or running directly affects the number of calories burned. A higher number of steps taken over longer distances, a sign of increased physical activity, is followed by increased calorie expenditure. Additionally, increasing calorie expenditure can aid in fat-burning and weight loss.

Daily activity seems to improve the quality of sleep. This underlines how crucial it is to include physical activity in daily life, both for its positive effects on health and the quality of one’s sleep.


#RECOMMENDATIONS 
        *In order to assist the marketing strategy in developing a data-driven marketing plan for Bellabeat’s future products and features, we can put the following recommendations into practice based on the insights obtained from the Fitbit smart device data:

-adding notifications encouraging activity after extended periods of inactivity can motivate users and help them stay on track towards a healthier lifestyle. This feature would serve as a proactive and supportive tool for individuals who are looking to incorporate more movement and activity into their daily routines. Improving the sleep monitoring capabilities is a crucial feature to give customers a more thorough and accurate understanding of the quality of their sleep.

-Inspire customers to post reviews of the product on social media and online review sites. This can give important information about what consumers want from a wearable health tracker.

-Provide excellent customer support and services to build customer loyalty and trust.
